# Utility to read the serial number of all attached removable USB drives

This small tool enumerates and shows system identifiers (i.e. serial numbers) of all attached USB flash devices (supports hot-plugging). 
The serial numbers can be used as a simple hardware key for user identification in other (probably custom) applications.
